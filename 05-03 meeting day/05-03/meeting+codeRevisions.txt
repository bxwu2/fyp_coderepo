- original
- needed to fix so no repeat neighbors
- add numEdges code to ensure no disconnections/isolated nodes
- histograms <-- convert to PDF
- added code to do commute/cover, with desired src/dst	
- add code to get a control network controlFlag while lloop
- add code to fix the problem where program runs forever (prevM)
-
- recursion formula
- fix errors here (added arrHopProb), allocate to correct prefix
- added absorbing node to fix wrongness

- finished hit time using recursion (NEED TO REDO THIS)

- did convolution but incorrect, need to fix loops

- need to add more absorbing nodes for efficiency

COMPLETELY REVAMP the hit/commute
and revisit cover time

MEETING 
- discussed the ^t of D matrix, recursion not needed
- also discussed where the j independence is not true
- discussed union and intersect symbols for this network (OR and AND)
- +-+- algorithm
- no need for statistical analysis, JUST COMPARE similar shape??
- impossible to be 100% accurate given nature of random walk

may 4 - ALSO NOTE, instead of summing everything, you can just do
sum(arr(:,Hop))
