- added code to ensure nodeSrc =/= nodeDst
- removed recursion, started again (using same network generation/same network)
- trans matrix, D matrix, Dt matrix, C matrix

- changed notation for plot titles (subscript ij)
- added code for creating return Hit time and plots (PDF/CDF)

- commuteTime CDF no problems after the meeting
- commuteTime PDF took ages but found the eventual error (using wrong index t instead of the right one commuteHop)
- added more comments/formatting


to ask
- re: CommuteTime, kij - 1, does that mean the array commuteCDF(t) is the CDF value for hop t-1?

to do
- clean up everything
- section them off again
- modify descriptions for journal entries, annotations, comments (PDF -> PMF)
- add title indexing (subscript ij) for the hit time plots
- COVER TIME LEFT
