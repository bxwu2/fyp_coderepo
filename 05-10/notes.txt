fixed term1 loop (coverIndex instead of t, so now term1 isnt the same number in the array)

completed the CDF and PMF codes for cover, but MAY NOT BE ACCURATE
need to check CDF code again
AND ALSO CONSIDER the minimum steps NEEDED for the cover to even begin

ALSO ARE THE NUMBERS supposed to match AT LEAST similarly? or is it purely the SHAPE
