for the 1st term of the cover time CDF equation
- if i simulate the cover time with starting node 2
- do I only sum the probability from STARTING node (2) to 1, 2 ... n i=/=z
- COMPARE WITH THE NOTATION ON THE LEFT OF COVER TIME PARAGRAPH (d^t_ix_j instead of x_j)


for the nth term
- i can simply add those in the union?
- ALSO, more importantly, when i=/= z, can i simply ignore all those situations??? 
  e.g. if i had 4 nodes, and the 3rd term: 123 124 134 234, and starting node was 1 ? can i only consider 234?

for the LAST TERM
- dont have to exclude z right?


---------------------------------
- implemented the new nchoosek code into the covertime code
- CODE IS A MESS, hard to decide where to start from,
- need to clean up code (isolate code for purely coverTime and so on)
- commenting is atrocious
- losing track of what  terms mean what
- this is how debugging is???
- BIG PROBLEM with indexing, is it t? it it n? etc????
- code oupttput even became negative for probabilities
- just noticed that simulated PMF seems different to the PMF histogram CHECK!!!!
