hit time and commute time done

not cover time


using Bar is good

or plot (, , '--o')
can use simulation as '-'

fixed hit time counterNode section code
if at node 3, it'll hop, but if it hops to node 4, then the next iteration would be "at 4" and then hop to 5 etc

all of that would count as 1 hop even tho it travelled more than once

created a switch case, more organised code for network generating, created new while loop conditions (simpler, more intuitive) need to think of better code name for conditions tho!!!

so PMF/PDF MATCHES!!!!

test for CDF and then

next up is commute time



TODAY TOOK MAYBE 4 HOURS OF MY TIME
took a long time to create correct conditions for while loop, as well ass fixing the 2 LINE OF CODE 
and also changed histogram to bar plot, as well as making new plot that superimposes the exp/sim for hit time
