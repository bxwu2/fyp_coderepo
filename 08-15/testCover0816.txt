spent an eternity indexing
everything



BUT FINALLY REALISED MY PROBLEM
always forget that dt is itself a CDF value
SO ALL THIS TIME ive been trying to find PDF of cover by using CDF values

fix everything change loop to have 1:t iteration isde, and also decided that would be easier for matlab if i just had 1 loop that would continuously sum (sum= sum+1) instead of having a 6 rows which i would then add afterward.


^ SLIGHTLY OFF THO THE PROBLEM STILL REMAINS THAT THE MINUS 1 OR nth TERM is not needed? or = 0?? or overcopmensates (resultant -1 or +1)


then aug16-  bring both graphs into the 1 m file, that is collate both PDF and CDF together.


NOTICED THAT for 2:n-2 almsot seems to work... it looks like the n-1th term also equals 1??????
